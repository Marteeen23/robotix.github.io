#### Introduction

It’s a time fraught with tension for the Avengers, charged with bringing the Tesseract, containing the Space Stone, one of the six Infinity Stones home to safety. The stone’s immense power has attracted hordes of villains and power hungry beings around the universe, who are lying in ambush. It is your job to map out a safe and secure path for Tony Stark to get home with the stone. His life, and the fate of the entire universe, is in your hands!

#### USP

*   Line Following Mechanism
*   RFID Card Reading
*   Path Planning and Optimization


#### Problem Statement

To build an autonomous robot capable of traversing through the arena through a safe and optimized path generated by solving algorithms on data transmitted by RFID cards, to reach the end point.

#### General Description and Event Setup

*   The arena will be a 5x5 grid, with white lines on a black background.

*   In Round 1, the arena will have one level, with each node(intersection of white lines) being a safe or an ambush point.

*   Round 2 is a virtual bi-dimensional arena with two levels stacked one on top of the other, aligning perfectly.

*   Each intersection of white paths, called a node, will have an RFID tag, transmitting integer data.

*   The data transmitted will be of the format- (number of points of ambush around it on Level 1, number of points of ambush around it on Level 2). For example, 24 at one node means on the 1st level, there are 2 ambush points around it and on the 2nd level, there are 4 ambush points all around it. The start node is safe.

*   The maximum integer possible integer in the above format is 44, 4 ambush points around the node on level 1 and 4 ambush points around the same node on level 2.

Note: Ambush points around a node means ambush points in the nodes in front, behind, to the left, right, above, and below that node.

#### Arena

##### Both Round 1 and Round 2

![](/img/event/tesseract/arena.jpg){:.img-responsive}

All dimensions are in cms. All RFID Cards are placed beneath the arena (readable using the sensor from on the bot).

##### Arena specifications

*   The distance between each node will be 35 centimetres.
*   The dimensions of each node will be 3.5 by 3.5 centimetres.
*   The line width is 3.5 centimetres.
*   The outer dimensions of the arena will be 200 x 200 cm.
*   The dimensions are to be considered with a maximum tolerance of 10%.

##### RFID Card Specifications

*   Universal readable using 13.56MHz RC522 RFID Reader Sensor.

*   “Credit Card” sized plastic white MIFARE RFID Cards with approximate dimensions 8.2cm by 5.2cm.

##### Robot Specification

*   The robot must fit in a cube of side 20 centimetres with a tolerance of 10% in its dimensions.

*   No part/mechanism of/on the bot should exceed the given dimensions before the commencement of the event.


##### Event Rules

*   The bot has to traverse the arena using line following mechanism.

*   The initial run can be traversed by the bot in whichever way it so chooses, beginning from the start node, storing data from all the nodes as it goes.

*   Once the bot has traversed the entire arena, (it has reached the diagonal end) it has to display the correct location of all the nodes of ambush (found using data from all the nodes it traversed during its initial run) on an LCD display, for a time of 3 seconds.

##### Timeouts and Re-runs
* A maximum of 6 re-runs can be taken. Penalty will be awarded for each re-run and the bot will start from the beginning of the arena.
* A restart can only be taken in case of a genuine technical fault in the robot. Team ROBOTIX can refuse a restart if the reason does not sound genuine enough, and their decision will be binding and final.
  
#### Round 1

##### Task

*   The arena will consist of 1 level. The bot has to traverse the arena and read the data from the RFID tag on each node.

*   After the first run, at the diagonally opposite point, the bot will have to display all the ambush points in the aforementioned format.

*   From the diagonally opposite point, the bot has to traverse the arena back, through a path free of ambush points and reach the end point (initially the start point).

*   There will be one return path.


#### Round 2

##### Task

*   The arena will consist of 2 virtual levels. The bot has to traverse the arena and read the data from the RFID tag on each node.

*   After the first run, at the diagonally opposite point at level 1, the bot will have to display all the ambush points in the aforementioned format.

*   From the diagonally opposite point, the bot has to traverse the arena back through a path free of ambush points on both the levels and reach the end point (initially the start point).

*   Throughout it's return journey, the bot will have to keep either 1 or 2 LED(s) glowing representing the level on which it is currently travelling.

* There will be 2 safe paths, one with higher energy, and one with lower energy, where energy increases with each level. The first level has lower energy than the second level. The bot that travels to the end through a lower energy path will be awarded higher points.


##### Scoring Formula

* **Positives**

Base score - 500(A)
Line following - 200(B)
Detection/display of each correct ambush point - 50(C)
Each safe node traversed while returning - 50(D)
(Round 2) For traversing the path with lesser energy - 200(E)

* **Negatives**
For each ambush point traversed while returning - 30(F)
For each re-run -100(G)
For damaging the arena - 400(H)

**Formula:**

A+B+50*C+50*D+200*E-30*F-100*G-400*H

##### General Rules

* Maximum number of participants allowed per team: **4 people**.

* The participants will be provided with **220 Volts, 50 Hz** standard AC supply.

* Only **16 bit** microcontrollers or below will be allowed.

* Participants will have to arrange for any other power supply required for their robot.

* Teams cannot tinker with their robots during the run.

* [LEGO kits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms) or its spare parts are not allowed.

* The decision of the Team Robotix will be **final** and **binding**.

* The rules are subject to change.

It is suggested to the participants to try making a wireless robot, powered by a battery on-board.
